The given data set is about the housing prices in USA.
Here I've performed Linear Regression on the data sets to predict the housing prices based on multiple dependent variables.
It is a step by step process.
Also the model is evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error,Mean squared error,Root mean squared error and Rsquared value.
